# Introduction

The goal of Project 2 is to choose 3 wide datasets and transform the datasets
- Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information included in the dataset.  You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears in the discussion item, so that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
- Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.  [Most of your grade will be based on this step!]
- Perform the analysis requested in the discussion item.
- Your codeshould be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis,and conclusions.
